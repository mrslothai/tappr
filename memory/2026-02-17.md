## Known Issues
- **Avatar upload broken** — Supabase `avatars` storage bucket doesn't exist yet; SQL sent to Rajesh to create it
- **Bio persistence unclear** — save code is correct but RLS update policy may be missing; waiting for Rajesh to run SQL and test
- **Second profile exists** — `rajeshchittyal` (rajeshchittyal21@gmail.com) with null bio/avatar

## Config Changes
- **Tester agent upgraded to Sonnet 4.5** (was Haiku 4.5) — Rajesh wanted production-quality testing
- Rajesh wants everything "perfect production ready"

## Rajesh Requests
- Asked for personal bio description for Tappr profile — gave multiple options
- Confirmed Claude Pro plan is $20/mo web subscription vs API pay-per-token (he's on API)
