## Overnight Task (Due 10 AM)
Rajesh reported CaptionCraft caption issues at 1:54 AM:
1. **Spelling mistakes** in Hinglish output (still some errors despite fixes)
2. **Timing issues** - captions go too fast, don't sync with video properly

### Action Plan
- 🔍 Researcher: Investigate root cause (Sarvam timestamp accuracy, spelling error sources)
- 💻 Coder: Implement fixes based on research findings  
- 🧪 Tester: Verify solution with real videos
- ⏰ Cron set for 9:30 AM to compile results and deliver to Rajesh

### Context
- Yesterday fixed Hinglish transliteration (9/9 tests passed)
- Sarvam API working with new key
- Pipeline: Hindi audio → Sarvam STT → Hinglish transliteration → ASS subtitles
- Current issue: Timestamps from Sarvam might be estimated (evenly distributed) not actual

## Previous Day Summary (2026-02-13)
- Built full Team Sloth (6 agents: Sloth, Coder, Creator, Researcher, Strategist, Tester)
- Fixed Hinglish transliteration in CaptionCraft
- Tested full pipeline with Sarvam API
- Switched Sloth from Opus to Sonnet (rate limit concerns)
- Team successfully delivered first project completion (Hinglish feature)
