## Key Events
- **3:30 AM** — Rajesh asked for a full AI agent team setup plan
  - Wants Sloth as team lead managing specialist agents
  - Saw people doing this on YouTube/X
  - Shared an OpenClaw ebook PDF (link expired, used docs instead)
  - Wants: give task → Sloth manages → agents complete → results delivered
  
## Research Done
- Read OpenClaw docs: multi-agent routing, sub-agents, sessions, agent workspace, config
- Analyzed current config: main agent + anthropic agent, Telegram channel, Kimi K2.5 default
- Decided on **sub-agent architecture** (not multi-agent) because:
  - Single Telegram interface (no extra bots)
  - Sloth manages everything
  - Cost efficient (Opus for lead, Sonnet/Kimi for workers)
  - Simpler setup

## Created
- `TEAM-BLUEPRINT.md` — Comprehensive team setup plan covering:
  - Architecture decision (sub-agents > multi-agent for this use case)
  - 5 team members: Sloth (lead), Coder, Creator, Researcher, Strategist
  - Workflow diagrams
  - Config changes needed
  - Cost analysis (~$32-67/mo vs $80-150/mo)
  - Real examples of task delegation
  - Phase 2 features (cron content calendar, research alerts)

## Ebook Summary
- Read full "OpenClaw: What People Are Actually Doing With It" PDF
- Key patterns: sub-agent spawning, CEO dashboards, content automation, morning briefings
- "John Wick" pattern: agent that built its own team to hit $20K MRR
- Ebook confirms sub-agent architecture is the proven approach
- Updated TEAM-BLUEPRINT.md with ebook insights + Quick Wins section

## Pending
- Rajesh needs to review TEAM-BLUEPRINT.md and approve
- Then implement: config update, workspace files, testing
- Wedding invitation video samples still pending from previous session

---

## Agent Team Built (~4-6 AM)
- Rajesh approved team plan, built all 5 specialist agents
- Each has own workspace, SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, AGENTS.md
- Created Tester agent (6th) after Rajesh said Sloth shouldn't do QA
- All agents registered in openclaw.json with cross-agent spawning

## Hinglish Transliteration Fixed
- Rewrote hinglish_transliterator.py with context-aware vowel handling
- 9/9 test cases now passing
- Uses LLM (Claude Haiku) for natural output, char-by-char fallback

## QR Connect — Full Build Cycle
- **Research**: Spawned Researcher → 23K word market analysis → verdict: BUILD IT
- **Build**: Spawned Coder → built Next.js 14 MVP with Tailwind, Supabase, qrcode.react
- **Bug fix**: Coder claimed "0 errors" but build FAILED. Sloth fixed:
  - Lazy `getSupabase()` initialization
  - `force-dynamic` on `[username]` page
  - Extracted `SaveContactButton` as client component
  - Fixed all `supabase.` → `getSupabase()` references
- **Deploy**: Deployed to Vercel at https://qr-connect-lake.vercel.app
- **Blocked**: Needs Supabase project for auth/data to work
- **Lesson**: NEVER trust subagent build reports without verification

## SmartPass Paused
- Rajesh said "stop that for now" after ugly UI + parser issues
- Was angry about quality — set new bar: "VC should think design team made it"

## Key Decisions Made
- QR Connect is PRIMARY vehicle for ₹1M ARR goal
- India-first pricing (₹199/mo vs Linktree ₹1000/mo)
- Switched main session to Opus 4.6 for creative/lead work
- Switched heartbeat to Haiku 4.5 (cheap autonomous ops)
- All reel scripts must be Hinglish (confirmed multiple times)
